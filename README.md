# The Twelve Days of Christmas

This project is based on the famous song "The Twelve Days of Christmas."  
In this program, the gifts are printed in reverse order for each day of Christmas.

## Description

- For each day, it prints a message for that day and then prints the gifts in reverse order (from the current day's gift down to the first gift).
